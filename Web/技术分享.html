      <h2>Radiometric Dating</h2>
      <p>Radiometric dating is a technique used to determine the absolute age of rocks and fossils by measuring the decay of naturally occurring radioactive isotopes. Methods such as uranium-lead, potassium-argon, and carbon-14 dating allow scientists to establish precise timelines of geological formations and fossil records. This technique is crucial in paleontology because it provides accurate temporal context for evolutionary events, enabling researchers to reconstruct the history of life on Earth with scientific confidence and detail.</p>

    <div class="tech">
      <img src="AI.PNG" alt="Imaging Fossils">
      <h2>AI-Powered Dinosaur Reconstructions</h2>
      <p>AI-powered reconstructions use advanced artificial intelligence algorithms to digitally recreate the appearance and anatomy of extinct dinosaurs. By analyzing fossilized bones, skeletal patterns, and known physiological data, AI can generate realistic 3D models that reveal posture, musculature, and possible movement. These reconstructions help paleontologists visualize behaviors, ecological interactions, and anatomical adaptations, while also providing immersive educational and research tools for museums and scientific studies.</p>

    <div class="tech">
      <img src="X ray.jpg" alt="Imaging Fossils">
      <h2>X-ray Fluorescence (XRF) Spectroscopy</h2>
      <p>X-ray fluorescence (XRF) spectroscopy is a non-destructive analytical technique used to determine the elemental composition of fossils and surrounding rocks. By irradiating samples with X-rays, XRF induces the emission of secondary (fluorescent) X-rays that correspond to specific elements. This method allows paleontologists to investigate mineral content, preservation conditions, and environmental history, offering insights into the fossilization process and the chemical interactions that occurred during the organism's burial and diagenesis.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tech">
      <img src="实地考古.png" alt="Imaging Fossils">
      <h2>Tech-Driven Digs: Precision in the Field</h2>
      <p>Modern fossil excavation combines traditional fieldwork with technological tools to ensure precise and safe recovery of specimens. Techniques such as GPS mapping, laser scanning, and digital recording allow paleontologists to document the exact location and orientation of each fossil. This high-precision approach reduces damage to fragile remains, facilitates accurate stratigraphic analysis, and creates detailed digital archives that can be used for research, virtual reconstruction, and educational outreach.</p>

      <img src="3D 脚印.png" alt="Imaging Fossils">
      <h2>Footprints in 3D: Walking with Dinosaurs</h2>
      <p>3D scanning and modeling of fossilized footprints enable researchers to study the locomotion, behavior, and group dynamics of extinct species. Using laser scanners or photogrammetry, paleontologists can create precise digital replicas of tracks, preserving minute details that may be lost over time. These 3D models help scientists analyze stride patterns, estimate speed and weight, and understand social behavior, while also offering engaging visualizations for museums and educational platforms.</p>

    <div class="tech">
      <img src="Ancient DNA Analysis.jpg" alt="Imaging Fossils">
      <h2>Ancient DNA Analysis</h2>
      <p>Ancient DNA (aDNA) analysis involves extracting genetic material from exceptionally well-preserved fossil remains. This technique provides information on evolutionary relationships, population genetics, and species diversity that cannot be inferred from morphology alone. Despite its challenges, such as degradation and contamination, aDNA has allowed scientists to reconstruct phylogenetic trees, study extinct species' adaptation patterns, and even explore connections between ancient organisms and their modern descendants, deepening our understanding of evolutionary history.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="tech">
      <img src="Molecular Paleontology.jpg" alt="Imaging Fossils">
      <h2>Biomarker / Molecular Paleontology</h2>
      <p>Molecular paleontology focuses on detecting and analyzing organic molecules preserved in fossils, such as pigments, proteins, and lipids. Biomarker studies reveal information about ancient diets, metabolism, coloration, and environmental conditions. By identifying these molecular remnants, scientists can reconstruct aspects of the organism's biology that are invisible in the skeletal record. This field bridges chemistry and paleontology, providing unique insights into the physiology and ecology of long-extinct species.</p>

    <div class="tech">
      <img src="Fossil Conservation.png" alt="Imaging Fossils">
      <h2>Fossil Conservation</h2>
      <p>Fossil conservation encompasses methods used to preserve and protect delicate specimens from deterioration. Techniques include chemical consolidation, controlled environmental storage, and careful handling procedures. Conservators may use specialized adhesives, supports, and coatings to stabilize fragile fossils while maintaining their scientific integrity. Effective conservation ensures that specimens remain available for future research, education, and display, allowing paleontologists and the public to study these invaluable records of ancient life for generations to come.</p>
